## React Native test assignment

### How to run

This project is made with Expo, so Expo and all the other used packages (React Native Elements, React Navigation) need to be installed in addition to React Native. Then the app can be run locally and used on your phone with the Expo app.
An APK is also included under releases, which can be installed on your phone or launched on an emulator.

  ```sh
  npx expo start
  ```
